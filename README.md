# csharp.nanorc
Syntax highlighting for C# in GNU nano

## How to install
Copy the csharp.nanorc file to */usr/share/nano/* to enable it for all users.
If you want to install it only for the current user, create or edit the *\~/.nanorc* file and add a line like this:
```
include "~/.nano/*.nanorc"
```
This will make nano use all .nanorc files found in *\~/.nano/* so copy the csharp.nanorc there.
